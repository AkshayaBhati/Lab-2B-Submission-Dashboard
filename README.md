## Blinking the LED ##

As you can see here we are using a Breadboard, Adafruit QT Py RP2040, one resistor, RED LED, and Jumper wires. They are connected as shown in the picture below: <br>

*LED Circuit*
<br>

After running our LED code with the same procedure as mentioned in the setup guide for Hello World <br>

https://github.com/AkshayaBhati/ESE-519-Lab-2-Setup-Guide/blob/main/README.md <br>

We can see the LED Blinking <br>

## Lab 2B Proposal ##

First, we will detect if there is light or not using the sensor, just like an LDR. So when there is no light, we can use motion to detect direction. Here we will use the Gesture sensing from the previous labs. The LED will glow in the shape of an arrow in the direction our hand is moving. If the right direction then 8 LEDs will glow, making a pattern of an arrow in the right direction and similarly for the left. It resembles the car's rear indicators. <br>
