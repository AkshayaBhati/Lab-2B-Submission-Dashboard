## Blinking the LED ##

As you can see here we are using a Breadboard, Adafruit QT Py RP2040, one resistor, RED LED, and Jumper wires. They are connected as shown in the picture below:

After running our LED code with the same procedure as mentioned in the setup guide for Hello World
https://github.com/AkshayaBhati/ESE-519-Lab-2-Setup-Guide/blob/main/README.md

We can see the LED Blinking

## Lab 2B Proposal ##

First we will detect using the sensor if there is light or not, just like an LDR. So when there is no light, we can use motion to detect direction. Here we will use the Gesture sensing from the previous labs, depending on which direcction the hand is moving the LED will glow. If right then 8 LEDs will glow making a pattern of an arrow

resembles car's rear indicators.


## Components Required ##

10 LEDs
10 Resistors
Jumper wires
